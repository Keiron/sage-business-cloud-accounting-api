This package provides a means easily of interacting with the Sage Business Cloud Accounting API.

## Installation

Add the client to your project using composer.

    composer require olsgreen/sage-business-cloud-accounting-api

## Usage
Sage require that you exchange your key & secret for an access token, this is then used to access the API. 

You can handle authentication and obtain an access token by using my other package that [olsgreen/oauth2-sage-business-cloud](https://github.com/olsgreen/oauth2-sage-business-cloud) for the [PHP Leagues oAuth2 Client package](https://oauth2-client.thephpleague.com).

## Examples

### Creating a basic Contact

```php
    $sage = new \Olsgreen\SageBusinessCloud\Accounting\Client([
        'access_token' => 'your_acess_token'
    ]);

    $contact = $sage->contacts()->create('Peter Jones', ['CUSTOMER']);

    // [
    //     "id" => "4d63c58e4a8943ff81a5b1809b98e58a",
    //     "displayed_as" => "Peter Jones",
    //     "$path" => "/contacts/4d63c58e4a8943ff81a5b1809b98e58a",
    //     "created_at" => "2021-08-10T15:57:42Z",
    //     "updated_at" => "2021-08-10T15:57:42Z",
    //     ...
